    "level": "CET4",
    "content": "Balancing study and leisure is essential for university students. Long hours at the library can improve grades, yet they also drain energy. Setting aside a little time for exercise or music refreshes the mind. I usually finish my homework before dinner and then play basketball with friends. The thirty minute break keeps me cheerful and focused. When exams approach, leisure activities become shorter but they never disappear. A healthy balance enables lasting curiosity and better performance."

    "title": "Balancing Study and Leisure",
    "level": "CET6",
    "content": "Maintaining a dynamic balance between academic commitments and leisure pursuits requires strategy. Intensive study sessions sharpen analytical skills, yet prolonged stress erodes creativity. I craft weekly schedules that interleave research tasks with restorative activities such as chamber music rehearsal or jogging along the river. These intentional pauses prevent burnout and stimulate fresh insights. When deadlines loom, leisure windows shrink but remain nonnegotiable. Sustainable excellence emerges from rhythm rather than relentless pressure."
